Spiritual Knowledge: A Comprehensive Guide

1. Introduction to Spirituality
Spirituality is the exploration of the deeper meaning of life, beyond the material and physical aspects of existence. It involves understanding the self, the universe, and the connection between the two. Unlike religion, which may focus on structured beliefs and practices, spirituality is often a personal journey toward truth, peace, and liberation.

2. The Nature of the Self
One of the central themes in spirituality is the concept of the 'Self'. Many traditions describe the self as more than the body and mind – it is the eternal, unchanging consciousness that witnesses all experiences. This realization is referred to as 'Self-Realization' or 'Atma Jnana' in Vedantic philosophy.
